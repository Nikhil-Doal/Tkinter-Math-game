# Tkinter-Math-game
# Description: This program is a math flash card game created using the Tkinter
#             library in Python. It helps users practice basic arithmetic
#             operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
#             division, and remainder. The game consists of four levels, each 
#             with a different range of numbers, getting more difficult.
#             There are 5 pages in the game: the start screen, the level
#             selection screen, the level screen, a settings screen and a
#             question log

#             The main features of the program include:
#                - Level selection screen allowing users to choose their desired
#                  difficulty level
#                - Progress tracking with correct, incorrect, and total number
#                  of answers
#                - Previous question and user answer display for reference
#                - Log to record and view previous questions and user answers
#                - Reset functionality to start a level from scratch
#                - Settings screen to customize the operators and option to
#                  include negative numbers
#                - A progress bar and text with percentage of total correct
#                  answers
#                - Valid input checking to ensure the user enters a valid answer
#                - Ability to submit answers using the Enter key

#             The program utilizes various Tkinter components, including labels,
#             buttons, frames, and images for the user interface. It also makes
#             use of random number generation to generate questions based on the
#             selected level and operator preferences.

#             To play the game, the user selects a level, answers the displayed
#             math questions by entering the answer in the input box, and
#             submits the answer. The program provides immediate feedback on the
#             correctness of the answer and updates the progress bar
#             accordingly. The user can also view the question log to review
#             their previous answers and track their progress.
